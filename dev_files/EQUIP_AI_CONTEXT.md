# EQuIP Program Context for AI Email Assistant

## Program Overview

**EQuIP (Eventus Quality Initiative Program)** is a quarterly clinical quality incentive program launched in January 2025. It offers awards to eligible providers four times per year (up to $1,500 per quarter) to incentivize participation in outcome-centered healthcare and quality documentation practices.

**Key Details:**
- **Launch Date**: January 2025
- **Frequency**: Quarterly bonus program
- **Maximum Award**: $1,500 per quarter
- **Program Type**: Performance-based incentive tied to clinical quality measures

---

## Eligibility Requirements

To participate in EQuIP, providers must meet **ALL** of the following criteria **at the beginning of the quarter**:

1. **Employment Status**: Full-time provider
2. **Specialty**: Primary Care, Psychiatry, or Palliative Care provider
3. **Compensation Model**: Must be on paid productivity (not salaried)

### Critical Eligibility Rules

- **Eligibility is locked at quarter start** - Must meet all criteria on Day 1 of the quarter
- **Mid-quarter changes disqualify you** - Switching from full-time to part-time OR from productivity to salaried during the quarter makes you ineligible for that quarter's award
- **No retroactive eligibility** - Becoming eligible mid-quarter does NOT qualify you for that quarter's bonus

---

## Two-Tier Measurement System

EQuIP uses a two-tier system: **Gate Measures** (all-or-nothing) and **Core Measures** (performance-based).

### Tier 1: Gate Measures (All-or-Nothing)

**Critical Rules:**
- Must pass **ALL** gate measures to qualify for any award
- Failing **ANY SINGLE** gate measure = **$0 award** (regardless of core measure performance)
- Most gate measures require **≥90% completion rate**
- Gate measures are measured only on **LTC ACO patients**
- Gate measures **vary by quarter and specialty**

**Why This Matters:** If you score 89% on just one gate measure, you receive $0, even if you scored 100% on all other gate measures and all core measures.

### Tier 2: Core Measures (Performance-Based)

**The Three Core Measures** (consistent across all quarters and specialties):

1. **PIMs (Potentially Inappropriate Medications)**
   - Monthly audit of all active patients on provider's caseload
   - Evaluates prescribing habits for red flag medications
   - Scores based on population-level medication appropriateness

2. **Coding (Billing & Coding Audits)**
   - Evaluates accuracy of coding and billing in documentation
   - Conducted by Michelle Cooke's team
   - Occurs periodically throughout the quarter

3. **Signature Standards (Quality/Clinical Documentation)**
   - Audits quality of clinical documentation outside of billing/coding
   - Conducted by Cortney Kuler's team
   - Occurs periodically throughout the quarter

**Core Measure Award Calculation:**

Your three core measure scores are averaged to produce a "Total Performance" score:

| Average Core Measure Performance | Award Amount | Percentage of Base |
| -------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| ≥90%                             | $1,500       | 100%               |
| ≥80% (but <90%)                  | $750         | 50%                |
| ≥70% (but <80%)                  | $375         | 25%                |
| <70%                             | $0           | 0%                 |

**Important:** Core measures only matter if you pass ALL gate measures. If you fail any gate measure, you receive $0 regardless of core measure performance.

## Gate Measures by Quarter and Specialty

### Q1 2025 (January - March)

| Specialty       | Gate Measure(s)        | Threshold |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | --------- |
| Primary Care    | Annual Wellness Visits | ≥90%      |
| Psychiatry      | Not yet eligible       | N/A       |
| Palliative Care | Not yet eligible       | N/A       |

**Note:** Q1 was primary care only.

---

### Q2 2025 (April - June)

| Specialty       | Gate Measure(s)                                                               | Threshold |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Primary Care    | • Annual Wellness Visits<br>• PHQ-9 (for patients NOT followed by psychiatry) | ≥90% each |
| Psychiatry      | PHQ-9 (for any patients followed by psychiatry)                               | ≥90%      |
| Palliative Care | No gate measures                                                              | N/A       |

**PHQ-9 Responsibility Rule:** If a patient is cared for by psychiatry, psychiatry is responsible for the PHQ-9 measure, even if primary care is also involved. If there is no psychiatry, primary care is responsible.

---

### Q3 2025 (July - September)

| Specialty       | Gate Measure(s)                                                                      | Threshold |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| Primary Care    | • Annual Wellness Visits<br>• PHQ-9<br>• A1C (Diabetes)<br>• Breast Cancer Screening | ≥90% each |
| Psychiatry      | PHQ-9                                                                                | ≥90%      |
| Palliative Care | Advanced Care Planning                                                               | ≥90%      |

**Q3 Special Note:** Breast cancer screening was converted to a group measure due to small denominators. The threshold was lowered to 50% group average, and all eligible providers passed.

---

### Q4 2025 (October - December)

| Specialty       | Gate Measure(s)                                                            | Threshold |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Primary Care    | • PHQ-9<br>• A1C (Diabetes)<br>• Breast Cancer Screening<br>• Hypertension | ≥90% each |
| Psychiatry      | PHQ-9                                                                      | ≥90%      |
| Palliative Care | Advanced Care Planning                                                     | ≥90%      |

**Q4 Changes:** Annual Wellness Visits **removed** as a gate measure for primary care. Hypertension **added** as a new gate measure.

**Ongoing Issue (as of Q4):** Decision pending on how to handle breast cancer screening in Q4 (whether to continue group measure approach or revert to individual measures).

---

## Award Calculation Process

### Step 1: Pass All Gate Measures
Provider must achieve ≥90% on **EVERY** gate measure to be eligible for any bonus.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Performance Score
Average the scores across all three core measures (PIMs, Coding, Signature Standards).

### Step 3: Determine Award Amount
Based on the total performance score (see Core Measures table above).

**Example:**
- Gate Measures: All passed (≥90% each)
- Core Measures: Coding 92%, Signature Standards 88%, PIMs 94%
- Average: 91.3% → **Award: $1,500** (100% of base award)

---

## Patient Attribution Methodology

**For All Measures (PIMs and all others):**
- Providers are attributed to facilities based on the **GLR (Group Location Report)**
- Patients are then identified based on those facility assignments
- This methodology aggregates all relevant patients for each provider's measurements

**For Gate Measures (Q1-Q4 2025):**
- Only **ACO patients (LTC ACO patients)** are counted in the denominator
- This creates significant variability in denominator sizes across providers
- Some providers have zero ACO patients, others have many

**Important:** If you have zero patients in the denominator for a gate measure, you automatically receive 100% for that measure (you pass).

---

## Special Considerations and Common Issues

### Low Denominator Problem

Many providers have very small ACO patient populations, which creates challenges:
- **Example**: If a provider has fewer than 10 ACO patients, a single patient refusal can cause failure of a gate measure
- This issue was especially pronounced for breast cancer screening in Q3
- Leadership applied exceptions in some cases (e.g., A1C exceptions when patients refused labs despite provider efforts)

### Documentation Requirements

- **Starting in Q3**: Documentation must be correct the first time - addendums/corrections are **NOT accepted**
- **Q2 Exception**: Providers were allowed to make corrections/addendums if documentation was in the wrong location (this leniency was removed in Q3)
- Proper documentation training is critical, especially given small denominators

### Exceptional Circumstances

- When measures are unmet, exceptional circumstances are typically handled **retroactively**
- Providers who don't receive a bonus can email to request review
- Manual reviews and exceptions are granted on a case-by-case basis
- **No documented, transparent criteria** for when exceptions will be granted (this is a known program deficiency)

### Patient Refusals

- Providers can do everything right and still fail due to patient refusal
- This is especially problematic with small denominators
- Some patient refusals result in exceptions, others don't - **inconsistent application**
- A1C exceptions have been granted when patients refused labs despite provider efforts

- **Week 2-3**: Eligible providers receive communication about eligibility, gate measures, core measures, and dashboard links

### Throughout the Quarter
- **Monthly**: PIMs results posted to dashboard at end of each month
- **Periodic**: Coding and Signature Standards audits occur throughout quarter
- **Ongoing**: Value-Based Care Team (Sandra Jurani) sends individual emails to providers with unmet measure lists

### End of Quarter
- Results snapshot shared with supervisors first
- Supervisor review period for accuracy and exceptions
- Reconciliation and manual adjustments
- Provider notification letters with gate measure performance, core measure performance, total performance, and award amount
- Awards processed through payroll

## Critical Rules Summary

### Must-Know Facts

1. **All Gate Measures Must Be Met** - This is pass/fail. If you fail even one gate measure, you receive no bonus regardless of how well you performed on other measures.

2. **Eligibility Is Locked at Quarter Start** - You must be full-time and on productivity at the beginning of the quarter. Becoming eligible mid-quarter does not make you eligible for that quarter's bonus.

3. **Mid-Quarter Status Changes Disqualify You** - Switching from full-time to part-time or from productivity to salaried during the quarter makes you ineligible for that quarter's award.

4. **Gate Measures Are ACO-Patient Only** - In 2025, only your LTC ACO patients count toward gate measure calculations, which can create small denominators.

5. **Core Measures Are Consistent** - Coding, Signature Standards, and PIMs are evaluated every quarter for all providers across all specialties.

6. **The 90% Rule** - Most gate measures require ≥90% completion rate. Core measures averaged at ≥90% give you the full $1,500.

7. **Zero Denominator = Automatic Pass** - If you have zero patients in the denominator for a gate measure, you automatically receive 100% for that measure.

8. **No Addendums Starting Q3** - Documentation must be correct the first time. Starting in Q3, corrections/addendums are not accepted.

## Common Questions and Answers

### Eligibility Questions

**Q: I just switched to productivity in the middle of the quarter. Am I eligible for this quarter's bonus?**
A: No. You must be on productivity at the beginning of the quarter to be eligible. You will be eligible for the next quarter if you remain on productivity.

**Q: I'm currently part-time but work 35+ hours per week. Am I eligible?**
A: No. You must have a full-time employment designation to be eligible, regardless of hours worked.

**Q: I was full-time and productivity on Day 1 of the quarter, but switched to salaried on Day 45. Will I get a bonus?**
A: No. You must maintain full-time productivity status throughout the entire quarter to remain eligible.

### Gate Measure Questions

**Q: I passed 3 out of 4 gate measures with over 95%. I failed one gate measure with 89%. Do I get anything?**
A: No. Gate measures are all-or-nothing. Failing one gate measure means you fail all of them and receive $0.

**Q: I have zero ACO patients for breast cancer screening. What's my score?**
A: If you have zero patients in the denominator, you automatically receive 100% for that measure (you pass).

**Q: Why do I have so few ACO patients?**
A: LTC ACO patient status is determined by payer and enrollment. Not all patients qualify as LTC ACO patients. This is outside of provider control.

### Core Measure Questions

**Q: How often are coding audits done?**
A: Coding audits occur periodically throughout the quarter. The cadence is not fixed. Results are posted to the dashboard as they are completed.

**Q: What if I disagree with my PIMs score?**
A: Contact Barbara Pereira or Monica Leriger. They can review your panel, explain which patients/medications are contributing to your score, and provide guidance on deprescribing.

**Q: My core measures are 92%, 85%, and 78%. What's my award?**
A: Your average is 85%, which is ≥80% but <90%. You receive 50% of the base award = **$750**.

**Q: If I fail a gate measure, do my core measures still matter?**
A: No. If you fail a gate measure, you receive $0 regardless of core measure performance. Core measures only matter if you pass all gate measures.

### Documentation Questions

**Q: I documented a PHQ-9 but it's not showing as complete on the dashboard. What happened?**
A: You may have documented it in the wrong location/field. Check the documentation requirements for PHQ-9 in the wiki. Unfortunately, addendums are no longer accepted (starting Q3), but you can reach out to the team to understand what went wrong for future quarters.

**Q: Can I go back and fix documentation errors after the quarter ends?**
A: No. Starting in Q3, addendums are not accepted. You must document correctly during the quarter.

## Program Philosophy

The EQuIP program is designed to:
1. Incentivize participation in outcome-centered healthcare
2. Align provider behavior with ACO quality measures
3. Drive improvement in clinical documentation quality
4. Encourage appropriate prescribing practices
5. Support value-based care initiatives

The "gate + core" structure ensures providers meet minimum thresholds (gates) while rewarding overall quality performance (core measures).

---

## Known Program Challenges

### ACO Denominator Variability
- Some providers have 0-10 ACO patients, others have many
- Creates perception of unfairness when small denominators cause failures
- Approximately 1/3 of providers had ZERO denominator for breast cancer screening in Q3

### Inconsistent Exception Policies
- Standards for corrections/exceptions have changed (Q2 allowed corrections, Q3+ did not)
- Breast cancer screening got group measure exception in Q3, A1C did not get similar accommodation
- Unclear criteria for when exceptions will be granted

### Documentation Gaps
- Biggest knowledge gap: "how to close gaps" documentation
- A1C documentation needs improvement for clarity
- Wiki documentation may reference previous quarters

### Communication Challenges
- No consistent communication cadence throughout quarter
- Providers often discover issues too late to fix
- Information scattered across multiple sources (wiki, emails, in-services, dashboards)

## Important Notes for Email Responses

1. **Always verify the current quarter** - Gate measures change quarterly, so confirm which quarter the question is about

2. **Be clear about the all-or-nothing gate structure** - Many providers don't understand that failing one gate = $0

3. **Acknowledge fairness concerns** - The ACO denominator problem is a known issue; be empathetic while explaining the rules

4. **Direct to appropriate contacts** - Use the contact matrix above to route questions correctly

5. **Emphasize early action** - Encourage providers to check dashboards regularly and address issues during the quarter, not after

6. **Clarify eligibility timing** - Many providers misunderstand that eligibility is locked at quarter start

7. **Explain zero denominator rule** - Providers with zero ACO patients automatically pass that gate measure

8. **Be transparent about exceptions** - Acknowledge that exceptions exist but criteria are not clearly documented; direct to Clinical Quality team for case-by-case review
